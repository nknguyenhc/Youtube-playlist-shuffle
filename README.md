Truly shuffle your Youtube playlists

Demo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nvl0cGlARE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nvl0cGlARE)

## Features

Listen to Youtube music frequently? Youtube shuffling only randomises the first video, but play in order for the second video onwards.

Add this extension to your browser! We will automatically shuffle playlists.

* Generate a fixed order for one full cycle, ensuring that all songs are played within one cycle.
* Allow disabling shuffling or stop at the last song for playlists you indicate.
* Press next to go to the next random song.

## Usage

1. Install this extension to your browser. If you wish to install this extension directly from this repository, you can follow installation instructions in the development section below.
2. Open your playlist on Youtube. It can be a playlist you have prepared, or a mix generated by Youtube. By default, shuffling is enabled, and will start playing random songs from the next song.
3. In the list of extensions on the top right corner of your browser, click on our icon. You can customise your choices for your current playlist from the popup.
4. To go the next song, pull the time indicator of the video to around 1s before the end. Do not pull to the very end and press next.

## Useful information

### Permission justification

#### Active tab

We need to use active tab so that the popup knows which playlist to shuffle. The popup is responsible for handling user preferences, such as turning off shuffling for a playlist, or disable looping. For the popup to get which playlist the user is playing, we need to get the active tab information.

#### Storage

Storage is the means of communication between the popup and the content script. Popup needs to be able to write to storage to indicate user preferences, and content script must be able to read from storage to shuffle/stop shuffling accordingly.

#### Host permission

We need to host permission to enable active tab and storage. Furthermore, we use a content script to shuffle the playlist for user, which also requires host permission.

#### Remote code

We are not using remote code. The `<script>` tag included in the popup HTML points to a script within our package.

### Data usage

We do not collect any data from users.

## Future directions

Our extension are still in early development stage, and hence is not yet able to fully control Youtube playlists. We hope that in a future version, we can:

* Control the next video of Youtube, allowing users to pull video time indicator to the very end to move onto the next video in the shuffle.
